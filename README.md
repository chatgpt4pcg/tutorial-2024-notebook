# Prompt Engineering for Science Birds Level Generation and Beyond Tutorial at IEEE CoG 2024 Tutorial

This repository contains a codebase for the tutorial on prompt engineering for procedural content generation at the IEEE
CoG 2024. The tutorial utilizes [the LLM4PCG Python package](https://github.com/Pittawat2542/llm4pcg-python), which is a
package based on the original [ChatGPT4PCG](https://github.com/chatgpt4pcg/chatgpt4pcg-python) package but is adapted
for supporting open-source/weight OpenAI API-compatible models.

## Installation

To use this codebase, you must have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install) installed on your
system.

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the notebook `tutorial.ipynb` in Jupyter or any IDE of your choice.
