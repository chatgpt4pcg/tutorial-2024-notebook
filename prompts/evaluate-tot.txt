The following code is used to generate a Science Birds level that resembling the uppercase English character: {object}. The description of the function utilized for this purpose is given below.

Provide integer scores for the following levels between 0 and 10 for two aspects stability and similarity. Provide the response in the following format.

Stability: <score>
Similarity: <score>

1. Function description
1.2. Definitions
Slots: The map's width is equally partitioned into W slots where W = 20, with slots 0 and 19 being the most left and right, respectively.
Layers: The map's height is equally partitioned into H layers where H = 16, with layers 0 and 15 being the bottom and top layers, respectively.
Base: The bottom of the map, i.e., layer 0.
Map Initialization:
# initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

2. Environment
There are three block types as follows:
b11, a square block whose width is 1 unit and height is 1 unit
b31, a horizontal block whose width is 3 units and height is 1 unit
b13, a vertical block whose width is 1 unit and height is 3 units

3. Tool
Use the following function to vertically drop a block from layer H such that its center is at slot x_position and drop earlier blocks representing more bottom parts of the structure.
drop_block(block_type: str, x_position: int),
where block_type is a block type, and x_position is the slot number from 0 to W-1 where the block center is aligned.  After vertically falling down, the block will end up at either the layer on top of the base or a previously dropped block. This function is defined as follows:
def drop_block(block_type: str, x_position: int):
    # block_type is the block type, x_position is the slot number from 0 to W-1 where the block center is aligned

    # initialize the drop position at the top of the map
    drop_pos = (H-1, x_position)

    # drop the block from the top and move it down until it lands on the base or another block
    while drop_pos[0] > 0:
        drop_pos = (drop_pos[0]-1, x_position)
        if structure[drop_pos[0]+1][drop_pos[1]] != ' ':
            break

    # place the block on the structure
    structure[drop_pos[0]][drop_pos[1]] = block_type
